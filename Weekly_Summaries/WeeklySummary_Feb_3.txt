Weekly Summary - Weeks of Feb. 10 & 17, 2019

What I worked on the last two weeks:
-- Created plots of calibrated and experimental data to assist in model selection
-- Further adjusted data frames for for-loops and dot plots
-- Finished for-loop code for calibrated data; close to finishing for-loop for experimental data (just a few errors to iron out)
-- Met with JC, MB, and Dr. Wang re: model selection, continuing discussion on model selection and verifying the direction JC and I are headed in
-- Ran other plate data set through framing code


What I will focus on during these upcoming weeks:
-- Calculate log values of cpD1 for additional plots
-- Create additional dot plots for meeting re: model selection w/ MB, JC and Dr. Wang
-- Write code for data transformations to be done prior to running adjustment mode
-- Finish the for-loop for experimental data
-- Meet w/ JC and Dr. Wang on Tuesday
-- Write more concise code to transform plate data prior to running through framing for adjustment model
