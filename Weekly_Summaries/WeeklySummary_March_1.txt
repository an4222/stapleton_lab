Weekly Summary - Weeks of March 3rd & March 10th

What I worked on the past two weeks:
- Finished/fixed errors in the for-loop to create experimental data frame
- Wrote code to combine/process different types of CSV files of plate data so any data provided can be processed by the adjustment model
- Ran other months' plate data through framing code to check errors
- Researched widely-used qPCR methods, incorporating the adjustment model for slopes of test1 and all_products
  --> Compiling summary for Dr. Wang and all for the purpose of having an explanation in one place
-  

What I will work in the next two weeks:
- Write summary for all regarding methods used in adjustment model, pre-analysis process
- Modify existing adjustment model to work with calibrated and experimental data frames
- Finish framing model and integration into one complete R code that can process both experimental and calibrated data through one streamlined process
- Meet with Holly Oates-Barker and JC to clarify analyses
- Make plan/schedule for rest of semester, remaining parts of project
