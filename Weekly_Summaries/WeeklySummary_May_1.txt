Weekly Summaries - Last two weeks in April & First two weeks in May

What I worked on the past weeks:
- Finished details of using ordinal logistic regression model for experimental observations s.q. prediction
- Explored and tested pairwise and non-pairwise ratio assumptions for use in OLRM
- Implemented z-score comparison test as alternative, more accurate method to predict starting quantities in experimental observations 
- Successfully completed the stress difference ratio for 11_2018, now ready for vQTL analysis
- Updated model output, visualizations; Uploaded to OSF
- Finished all Numpy tutorials (5 thru 14) in preparation for HSI
- Completed Scikit Image tutorial on image segmentation and region properties in preparation for HSI
- Created presentation and wrote documentation on adjustment model and OLRM methods for qPCR analysis. Usable as a reference/guide for RA's involved in qPCR later on


What I will work in the next two weeks:
- Use 2018_11 stress ratio output in vQTL analysis 
- Run other month's plate data thru qPCR analysis to compute stress difference 
--> For 2018_6, work with Julia to match odd sample ID numbers with correct (complete) sample IDs prior to input for vQTL analysis
--> Compare model output between months to evaluate appropriateness 
--> Verify effectiveness of non-pairwise assumption as opposed to pairwise
- Add code for invalid observations to be written in a separate CSV file including CP values, match with Sample ID and plate identifiers
- Look for places in code to improve efficiency and robustness 
- Meet with David Ruddell for next steps in HSI project
- Update all OSF files with new output
