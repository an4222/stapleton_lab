Weekly Summaries - Weeks of March 17; March 24; March 31; April 1

What I worked on the past weeks:
- Met with Dr. Wang and JC to iron-out methods and model used -- ordinal logistic model (OLR - ordinal logistic regression model) to predict starting quantities; Compare summary of OLR to logistic model based on percentiles of ratios
- Finished experimental data frame; fixed errors encountered with other months' plate data
- Fixed errors in calibrated data frame for 2018_11 month
- Verified other months' plate data runs through framing code
- Finished writing adjustment model code
- Created plots of calibrated vs. experimental CP values for model and methods justification
- Created and ran code to use ordinal logistic model (per Dr. Wang) to predict starting quantities of experimental samples
- Added code to remove invalid observations from the data set while framing to run the OLR
- Completed NSF researcher training course


What I will work in the next two weeks:
- Write code to match calibrated adjustment values with experimental samples after s.q. has been predicted via OLR
- Adjust OLR code to account for independence of calibrated data values (allP or test1) at each starting quantity
- Create code for another logistic model (based on percentile of ratio) for comparison with the ordinal logistic model fit -- finding most accurate method of prediction for our samples
- Add code for invalid observations to be written in a separate CSV file including CP values
- Write code to plot qPCR cycle data for observations with unusual CP values
- Compare ordinal logistic model with logistic model based on percentile summaries with Dr. Wang
- Continue working on presentation of methods, model, written summary for Dr. Wang
